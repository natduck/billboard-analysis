 Analyzing the Billboard Top 100 in the 21st Century
 We built a dashboard analyzing the top 100 Billboard songs in the 21st century using Python. The dashboard allows the user to choose a range of years, display different visualizations for song features including artists, genres, and lyrics, and recommend other Billboard top 100 songs based on the userâ€™s input song. Data was gathered from a variety of sources, from the Billboard top 100 website to Genius', last.fm's, and Spotify's APIs. These sources were utilized to consolidate song information into a master dataset that powers the dashboard. From there, several dashboard elements were implemented to make the dashboard a fun and user-friendly place to examine trends in the music industry.
 The dashboard can be viewed by running ```python billboard dashboard.py```
